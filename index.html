                Marsha P. Johnson was an African American transgender woman and revolutionary LGBTQ rights activist.

                Johnson spearheaded the Stonewall uprising in 1969 and along with Sylvia Rivera, 
                she later established the Street Transvestite (now Transgender) Action Revolutionaries 
                (STAR), a group committed to helping homeless transgender youth in New York City.
